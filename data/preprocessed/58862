Thanks to all who responded to my original post.  I got the number for
Western Digital tech support and determined that I need to upgrade the
BIOS to the Super BIOS.  It will handle hard drives with up to 16 read/
write heads and up to 1024 cylinders.  The upgrade is $15, payable by
check or money order.  Send to:

	Western Digital Corporation
	Technical Support Group
	P.O. Box 19665
	Irvine, CA  92713-9665

The Super BIOS is for any WD XT hard drive controller card in the
WD1002 series.

The BIOS on my system would only handle up to 20mb drives.

The responses to my request for help follow my .sig.  Warning: It's long.

Keith
