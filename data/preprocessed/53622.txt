andy collins writes thick need make pcb trace amp current anybody thought process kind pcb use material thickness copper advice graciously accepted four reply seen hard number go trace outside inner layer expect oz copper amp following temperature rise versus width sam reference data engineer seventh edition pg claim turn mil std width temp rise inch degree amp rise width degree power go square current plus copper resistance go temperature go certainly mm trace ample want ounce copper almost cut required width half oz width think given rated current amp transient fault condition another question voltage drop low enough able figure one wire table resistivity copper keep trace short use separate sensing trace appropriate mentioned another poster
