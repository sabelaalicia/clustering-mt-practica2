would like able amplify voltage signal output thermocouple preferably factor resulting voltage fed easily personal computer based adc data acquisition card might anyone able point reference circuit seen simple amplifier circuit sure well work practice case like something amplify sufficiently nicely used thermocouple say degree accuracy better pointer would greatly appreciated
