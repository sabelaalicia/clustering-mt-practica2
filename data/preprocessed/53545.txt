randy agee writes question radar detector detector actually detect would additional shielding grounding bypassing shield stray rf generated radar detector rf actually emitted detector antenna brand quieter others ok ham well tune mhz khz number sound like herd thats right guessed common number every super het receiver local oscillator generates detector detector detecting local oscillator two local oscillator generate way receiver want receiver something say ghz must generate local oscillator signal ghz mhz local osc frequency mhz fed normal agc ckt detector keyed uppon agc voltage mileage may vary since agc negative feed back device positive voltage set think get picture
