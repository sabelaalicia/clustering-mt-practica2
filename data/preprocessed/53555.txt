article john thomson writes thought mine since hook line aprox hook usually drop led series zener say around hook led hook led would work anyone try tried please let know aye rub draw enough current light led equipment phone company think gone hook hook state supposed draw current mean use digital voltmeter use old vom phone company equipment detect might think something wrong cable look guy problem want light go phone hook need run series line mentioned previous post want light go phone hook need voltage threshold detector going series diode thing easiest make sure led take current recall hand something like careful folk also consider vac hz forced ring tip phone supposed ring even simple zener led setup might end carbon real quick whatever scheme use make sure got least rated component frontend also remember mistaken phone line ohm equivalent circuit current draw get dropped across ohm fine roughly bell considers hook dropping far probably big easiest implementation accomplish tip rectifier resistor diode zener resistor led ring suggestion go ahead blow hole get idea choose high efficiency led need much current get light choose value component required aaron
