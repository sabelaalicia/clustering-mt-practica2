hi built valve preamp use diode capacitor voltage multiplier step vac supply voltage approx vdv load resistance increase rc constant decrease hence output voltage drop need high output voltage possible circuit consists seven voltage multiplier stage ie diode capacitor capacitor develops across take output across seven capacitor capacitor mfd increase capacitor rating mfd increase rc constant hence alleviate problem capacitor going little expensive need would happen connected mfd capacitor parallel output hence parallel seven mfd capacitor assume increase circuit hence increase rc time constant output voltage becomes stable killed two bird one stone experiencing hz ripple hence amp hum new capacitor smooth anyone recomend suitable value inductor choke placed output line power supply filter hz main hum lowest resistance possible got preamp moment much distraction university got get dissertation finished two week hence mailing playing solderoing iron cheaper long run especially new large capacitor work planned email please always read net thanks advance chris name mr chris smith twang ole guitar addrs uni liverpool university quest build hardware dgree computer science ever sun may certainly ball flaming gas lawrence view expressed reflect private thought
