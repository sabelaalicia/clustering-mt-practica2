writes initial symptom picture sound crt filament glow flyback ticking described abovew discovered hooked scope strip putting audio video signal everything making simple hz pulse horiz transistor collector case hz downgoing sawtooth ca khz ring front end guy going anyone seen happening turn tv horizontal output begin normal operation power high voltage rest circuitry problem sensed horizontal oscillator shuts power cycle repeat thing check first check shorted high power component best bet vertical output transistor one voltage regulator common cause type failure much current drawn somewhere also look shutdown circuit tv may may find one shutting horizontal oscillator hard find problem
