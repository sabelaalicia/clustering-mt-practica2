article david glen jacobowitz writes new scope thought save buck buying one function generator built hmm ad combination radio hand cranked generator flashlight siren saw function generator mv offset amplitude high way could make little box could solve little problem box would tkae function generator input lower voltage give output impedance low unchanging number would want lower voltage factor one hundred could build little buffer amp like box active sure already got right idea ignoring ohm internal resistance generator second run say voltage divider made ohm series ohm new circuit thevenin equivalent one put original voltage output impedence negligibly less ohm may want monkey value little depending whether care exact dividing ratio availability part hows sound joel kolstad high voltage probe multimeters accurate still cheap something like meg series load often high impedence source much well keeping probably meg impedance multimeter happy
