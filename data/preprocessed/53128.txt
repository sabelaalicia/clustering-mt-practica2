article jim carr writes agree come nuclear physic one often discusses particle hole excitation certain reaction effect applying annihilation operator creating hole subtle question longer one work real become also quasi particle raise sort question real entity phenomenon certainly real one ok asked new thread line ask large hole current run thru resistor cooling instead heating anyone design amplifier preferentially amplifies hole current normal electron current semiconductor material highest ratio hole mobility electron mobility please quote actual test sample rather estimate based theory also limited semiconductor consider also insulator resistor dielectric piezo electric conductor magnet metal ceramic magnetostrictives etc note summarize thread far stated area hole detectable vacuum hole particle exist presence matter previous thread stated hole exist certain semi conductor question naturally arises hole current inside semi conductor vanish point semiconductor joined conductor say copper want theoretical discussion whether hole could exist inside metal conductor rather ask experimental discussion amplify detect current exist also note cross posted sci electronics since becoming electronic discussion thanx eric et force nature
