soh kam yung writes understand need ground plane digital system however would like know ground plane also necessary analog system note ground plane connected except one point signal ground keep getting conflicting answer ground plane analog system help reduce noise also system deal low frequency signal hz well one reason getting conflicting answer depends want ground plane continuous conductor good electrostatic shield signal board need shielding rom thing shielding much good magnetic field unless make continuous around circuit shielded like faraday cage flip side coin working high impedance could end capacitance gound plane cause problem likely encounter hz khz real problem one bit
