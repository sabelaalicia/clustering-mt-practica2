new scope thought save buck buying one function generator built awhile noticed two thing function generator one seems bias even pull offset pushed pull know adjust get signal sans random mv bias really annoying thing damn output go student may guessed previous post often measure input impedance various circuit build many circuit maximum input signal way less mv amplitude input impedance kohm range thing order use function generator divide voltage thing reasonable course measurethe input impedance circuit going throw another resistor series ohm output generator could ignore little divider figure kind pain as way could make little box could solve little problem box would tkae function generator input lower voltage give output impedance low unchanging number would want lower voltage factor one hundred could build little buffer amp like box active quick idea scope broken reason sent shop get repaired replaced function generator way one please help feeling stupid today dave
