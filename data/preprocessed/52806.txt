look couple component catalogue came across range peltier effect heat pump intended cooling component heard effect put current one device pump heat one side reverse current reverse effect think temperature difference give emf well anyway struck could make nice cool hot box picnic one power regulator thermostat couple heat sink biggest device shift efficiency bad although would flatten car battery half hour unfortunately catalogue list anything basic spec heat pump imagine would get back emf temperature gradient across device increase presumably power decrease back emf increase eventually steady state current consumed assuming leakage final temperature difference two side could set supply voltage nothing although would lousy way control would like know guess correct open circuit thermal resistance typical device want sure coolbox going get warm fast unplug peltier effect heat pump actually work look like magic use thing domestic fridge freezer thanks advance paul
