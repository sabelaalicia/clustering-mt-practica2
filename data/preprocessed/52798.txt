fast dirty way kill line spiking occurs inductive load turned sometime zero crossing ac cycle capacitor kludged somehow etc got microcontroller running bunch valve pump big instrument washer almost everything switched zero crossing solid state relay stuff stay quiet ac wise one steam valve get turned mechanical relay water tank fill thermostat system control ssrs sometimes generate radiate spike reset one peripheral chip software time try love tack magic spike killing fix would avoid major rewiring redesign varistor would help might sufficient idea
