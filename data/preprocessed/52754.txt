article pqu john haddy writes article michael covington writes use big capacitor unreliable timing due leakage true especially electrolytic capacitor high temperature instead use quartz crystal divide frequency time something like crystal affected cold gut feeling mechanically resonating device extreme cold likely affect compliance terminology quartz hence resonant frequency low power quartz oscillator usually khz significant temperature drift one often notice wearing watch one wrist low temperature sensitivity available crystal type unfortunately larger higher frequency mhz take battery power programmable timer might less accurate power stingy suitable crystal oscillator john whitmore
